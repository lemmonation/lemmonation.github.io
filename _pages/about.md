I am a Researcher of [Deep and Reinforcement Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-and-reinforcement-learning-group/), Machine Learning Group at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). I obtained my Ph.D degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by Prof. [Linli Xu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~linlixu/) and Prof. [Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/). I received my bachelor’s degree in USTC at 2016.

I mainly work on machine learning and natural language processing, including machine translation, text classification, grammatical error correction, graph neural network, etc. 

**I'm always looking for highly-motivated interns with good coding and math skills to work with me on machine learning and natural language processing.** Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested (an internship period of at least 6 months is preferred). You can contact me through a@b, where a=junliangguo and b=microsoft.com.

I'm an amateur 5-dan [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) player.
